# Lessons & Continuous Improvement

- Capture actionable rules here after each plan execution.
- Each entry should mention:
  - **Date** and command (`/fastai-execute-plan`).
  - **Trigger** (e.g., user correction, failing tests, emotional feedback).
  - **Lesson** — concise instruction that prevents the issue.
- Keep bullets short and reference file paths or commands only when essential.
